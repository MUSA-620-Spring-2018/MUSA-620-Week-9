# Assignment <a id="assignment"></a>

Use the Twitter streaming API and sentiment analysis to examine the use of emojis on Twitter.

This assignment is **required**. Please turn it in by email to myself (galkamaxd at gmail) and Evan (ecernea at sas dot upenn dot edu).

**Due:** Wednesday, 28-March by 9am

### Description

The specifics of this assignment are open ended, subject to the following requirements:

* The analysis must involve at a minimum 10,000 tweets, collected via the Twitter streaming API. Search parameters are up to you.
* The tweets must be segmented by some characteristic(s) and compared on the basis of sentiment
* Emoji use must factor in to the analysis.

Examples:

* Are tweets with emojis happier than those without?
* Which emojis are the most positive and which are the most negative?
* Compare the emoji use sentiment of tweets mentioning @realdonaldtrump with those of a random sample of tweets.

### Emoji encodings

Emojis in streamed tweets can be identified by their byte code.

For example, "<ed><a0><bd><ed><b1><8d>" is the byte code for the thumbs up emoji. When you stream in a tweet containing this emoji, such as [this one](https://twitter.com/TheWWEWolfe/status/976187950252863491), its text will appear like this: "<ed><a0><bd><ed><b1><8d>nothing is impossible https://t.co/AckwyTxVjR".

You can find a full list of emojis and their associated encodings here: [emoji-encodings.csv](https://github.com/today-is-a-good-day/emojis/blob/master/emDict.csv) in the "streamEncodings" column.

Using these codes, you can identify any tweet containing a particular emoji by matching the text of the tweet against that emoji's byte code. See the emoji-template.r script for R code to get you started.

**Note:** These emoji encodings work only for the streaming API. Tweets collected via the REST API will have different encodings (also included in the emoji-encodings.csv).

### Deliverable

- A series of charts displaying your results
- the streaming tweet data you used in your analysis
- all R scripts used in scraping, analyzing, and visualizing the data and anything else I would need to replicate your analysis (without having to collect the tweets myself).
- a written explanation of: the steps you took to create it, any challenges you encountered along the way, and reasons for your design choices
